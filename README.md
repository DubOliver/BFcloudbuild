Clone and edit [Betaflight](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight) locally on your platform. This image will take it from there and turn your code into a binary which you then can flash to your flight controller with the [Betaflight Configurator](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator).

## Usage
### Install Docker
The latest docker platform is available from [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/products/overview#/install_the_platform). If your system does not meet the system requirements for the latest version, check out the [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox).
